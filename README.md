# Chinmoy Controversies

Was Sri Chinmoy yet another Indian Guru who sexually exploited countless followers in the name of spiritual progress? 
It is time to hold an inquiry to find out

In the early 1960’s Sri Chinmoy, together with his Canadian partner, Alo Devi,  set up a spiritual organisation in Queens, New York. There they taught meditation and their own unique version of Hinduism. Chinmoy’s organisation attracted seekers from all over the world, who came to him to learn his methods for making spiritual progress. At its height Chinmoy had several thousand disciples scattered across multiple countries. At the core of his teachings he claimed that to make spiritual progress seekers must adopt a celibate life-style.  He claimed he also was celibate.

Question: Do you practice celibacy?

Sri Chinmoy: Of course. Without celibacy, there can be no true spiritual life, not to speak of God-realisation.[i]

Around the end of 2001, allegations began to appear on the internet from women who claimed they had long-term sexual encounters with him. Sri Chinmoy insisted these stories were lies, and he forbade his disciples from searching for information about them on the internet. He continued to deny the stories until his death in 2007. His organisation survived his passing, and the official line still maintains he was a celibate master, and the current leaders still demand devotees live celibate lives. They claim the stories on the internet are false, put there by disgruntled former adherents. Over the years the number of women claiming to have had intimate relations with him increased, but The Sri Chinmoy Centre has never investigated these allegations.  They simply deny them and attempt to discredit the women who have made them.

The purpose of this blog is to call on the leaders of the Sri Chinmoy Centre to hold an independent inquiry into the truth of these allegations. Independent means it should be commissioned and paid for by the Sri Chinmoy Centre, but conducted by someone not associated with it.
